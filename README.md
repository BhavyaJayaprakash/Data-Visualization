Module 5 Data-Visualization homework assignment
Background:
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:

Prepare the data.

Generate summary statistics.

Create bar charts and pie charts.

Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

Calculate correlation and regression.

Submit your final analysis.

### Analysis

-The test data has been merged together, cleaned and Summarized for information resulting in bar charts, pie charts, the box plots, the line graph, scatter plot, and the correlation/regression plots.. • Based upon the statistical summary information, Capomulin and Ramicane had the greatest impact on reducing tumor volume • The bar charts showed the greatest number of tests executed on both Capomulin and Ramicane. 

The pie charts showed the distribution of male to female was about even within 1% of difference.
The Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots showed Capomulin and Ramicane impact on reducing tumor volume. Based upon the quartiles, it appears that Ramicane may have slightly better results because the upper quartile was slightly lower
The line plot for mouse l1509 using Capomulin treatment showed the tumor continued to grow until about day 20, then the tumor reduced in sized for the next few days days, and then started to grow again. I would appear the observations were stopped after about 45 days. 
The scatter plot combined with Linear regression showed a positive correlation between mouse weight and average volume of Tumor. It could be concluded that larger mice have larger tumors 

Conclusions:

Capomulin :
It is the most popular drug regimen among the mice tested
The weight of the mouse seemed to impact the volume of tumor. Tumor volume increased with average weight of mice.

Ramicane:
This might be slightly better than Capomulin based upon the box plot. It could be the most succesful drug treatment in reducing tumor size
